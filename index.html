    <br>They are aware of the impact of change, both short-term and long-term, on the human condition and in different spatial and temporal contexts.</br>
    <br>They also have a sense of historical empathy or regard for the motivations and actions of people in the past, in the context of their time.</br>
    <br>They can make judgements about the significance of events in the past, and appreciate the need to examine controversial or contested issues from more than one perspective.</br:

<h6>Element Acquiring the big picture<h6>
<p>The notion of the big picture relates to the idea of a usable historical framework that helps students see the past in a broad global context. 
<br>A big picture framework helps students to see significart patiems of change over time.</br>
<br>As students learn they can place their new knowedge and understandng in this framework, extending it and deepening it as they continue to ask questions of the past and acquire new knowledge and understanding.</br>
<br>The big picture also allows for students to deepen their chronological understanding and to appreciate how history is characterised by eras or ages of rapidly-taught big picture' of the past can be revisited and developed regularly over the three years of students' learning in junior cycle.</br>
